Hello, my name is Eric Chen (陈羿泓), a junior at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu), majoring in Management Information Systems, Mathematics, and Data Science. I'm also enrolled as a JEI (Joint Educational Institute) student at the [SWUFE-UD Institute of Data Science](https://dids.swufe.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China.

Currently, I serve as a teaching assistant for MISY330, Database Design and Implementation, and work as a research assistant supervised by Prof. [Tao Wang](https://gk.swufe.edu.cn/info/1083/1296.htm) at SWUFE. Additionally, I'm preparing to become an undergraduate research scholar supervised by Prof. [Harry Wang](http://harrywang.me) at UD.

In my role as a prompt engineer intern at [Takin.AI](https://takin.ai) and [HiddenArt.AI](https://hiddenart.ai), I concentrate on the development and enhancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) systems. My previous tenure as an algorithm engineer intern at [China Telecom](http://www.ffcs.cn) (中国电信) enriched my experience in NLP and AI training.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm a UD Student Alumni Ambassador ([UDSAA](https://www.udel.edu/alumni-friends/connect/students/student-alumni-ambassadors/)) and the former president of the SWUFE Fujian Fellows Association, roles that have refined my leadership abilities and event coordination skills.

In my leisure moments, I find joy in music and movies, having served as the principal horn player in the SWUFE Orchestra. I am also a fan of Chinese folk songs and traditional music, with [Gong Linna](http://www.gonglinna.com/index.html) being my favorite artist
