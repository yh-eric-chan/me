Hello, my name is Eric Chen (陈羿泓), a senior at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu), majoring in Management Information Systems, Mathematics, and Data Science. I am also part of the Joint Educational Institute (JEI) at the [SWUFE-UD Institute of Data Science](https://dids.swufe.edu.cn) in Chengdu, China.

Currently, I work as a part-time research assistant under Prof. Leting Zhang at the University of Delaware, focusing on privacy and cybersecurity using text mining and econometric methods. Previously, I was an Undergraduate Research Scholar, supervised by Prof. Harry Wang, with our research accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Information Technology and Systems (WITS) 2024. I have also served as a teaching assistant at UD.

In my professional experience, I have contributed to the development of Generative AI systems at [Takin.AI](https://takin.ai) and [HiddenArt.AI](https://hiddenart.ai). During my tenure as an algorithm engineer intern at [China Telecom](http://www.ffcs.cn), I gained hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP) and AI model training.

Outside of academics, I am a UD Student Alumni Ambassador ([UDSAA](https://www.udel.edu/alumni-friends/connect/students/student-alumni-ambassadors/)) and the former president of the SWUFE Fujian Fellows Association. These roles have helped me refine my leadership and event coordination skills. For more details, you can refer to my [CV](https://github.com/yh-eric-chan/yh-eric-chan.github.io/blob/main/assets/CV_Academic.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy music and movies. I have served as the principal horn player for the SWUFE Symphony Orchestra and am an avid fan of Chinese folk music and traditional songs.
