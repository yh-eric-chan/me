  **Supervisor:** Prof. Shangjia Dong at UD  
  **Stage:** Data Analysis  
  **Description:** This project examines whether large language models (LLMs) can emulate human-like decision-making behavior in disaster scenarios by combining novel AI technology with widely accepted theoretical frameworks like the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM).  
  **Collaborator:** Xiao Qian

- **Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Business Research Analytics**  
  **Funding:** UD Undergraduate Research Scholar, June 2024 - Aug 2024, $4,000  
  **Supervisor:** Prof. Harry Wang at UD  
  **Stage:** Accepted by Workshop on Information Technology and Information Systems (WITS) 2024<br>
